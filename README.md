# Investment-Analysis
The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. Goals of data analysis: Your goals are divided into three sub-goals: Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy. Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well. Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.) The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.
